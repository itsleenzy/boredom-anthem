## 🎵 Chorus

**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Scrolling through my mind, it’s an empty food court  
**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Tryna find a snack but, it is just a dang sport

## 🧠 Verse 1

Yeah, sittin' on my bed, got my hoodie half on,  
Dreamin' of a world where my boredom's just gone,  
Ideas poppin' off like popcorn in a pan,  
But my brain hit snooze — guess that's not the plan.

Now I'm tappin' on my desk like a wannabe band,  
Beat's in my head but it’s slippin' through my hands,  
Open up my notebook, doodles take the stand,  
Whole lotta chaos, but no real plan.

## 🎪 Verse 2

Mind’s doing flips like a circus stand,  
Dreams takin' detours like a traffic jam,  
Phone in my hand, but no one to text,  
Refreshin' my apps like, "what's coming next?"

Brain’s outta service, like "please hold the line,"  
Waiting for a spark, for a legendary sign,  
Staring at the ceiling, tryna find a clue,  
Man, I’m so lost... don't know what to do...

---

## 🎵 Chorus (repeat)

**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Scrolling through my mind, it’s an empty food court  
**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Tryna find a snack but, it is just a dang sport

## 🧹 Verse 3

Kickin' at the dust on my bedroom floor,  
Half-written rhymes crumpled near the door,  
Echoes of my thoughts bouncing off the wall,  
Waiting on a beat that will never call.

Clock’s tickin' slow like it's stuck in the mud,  
My dreams in my brain just thump and thud,  
Playlist’s on shuffle but it plays one song,  
I skip, I skip... but it’s stuck too long.

---

## 🎮 Verse 4

Glitchin' through the day like a broken game,  
Respawn, reset — but it’s all the same,  
Tried to make plans but they all fell through,  
Guess destiny’s ghosted me too.

Words in my head but they won't align,  
Chasin' my thoughts like they’re runnin' from time,  
Catchin' these feels that I can’t undo,  
Man, I’m so lost... don't know what to do...

---

## 🎵 Chorus (repeat)

**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Scrolling through my mind, it’s an empty food court  
**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Tryna find a snack but, it is just a dang sport

## 🌬️ Verse 5

Windows wide open but the breeze feels fake,  
Dreams on the line but they ain't awake,  
Light in my room but my heart stays blue,  
Building up castles that crumble in view.

Songs in my head but they don't break through,  
Running in circles in worn-out shoes,  
Lookin' for a sign but it's way past due,  
Man, I’m so lost... don't know what to do...

## 🔁 Final Chorus (fade out x2)

**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Scrolling through my mind, it’s an empty food court  
**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Tryna find a snack but, it is just a dang sport...

**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Scrolling through my mind, it’s an empty food court  
**I am so bored, I don’t know what to do**  
Tryna find a snack but, it is just a dang sport
